Multi_sg_rules.sh

this will add a portocol:all , port:all for an IP in a region to all the Security groups. (values need to be modified for IP and region in the file before it is ran)

it will be ran from within the CLI , in the file it does tracking for cloudshell user but that path can be changed. tracking files are good for checking SGs that change was made to and not made to succesfully.
